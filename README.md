Web Design Project

Purposer of the project was to create a website for pretty much anything. 

The general premise of the website I will create is to gather a musical groups: history, music, lyrics, and upcoming concerts etc. 
The goal is to create a website that can host all of these things under one roof. You currently have to go to several different sites 
to find many of the things I listed. There are separate lyrics sites, streaming sites, biography sites, and sites to actually buy music. 
Also, bands rarely have all of this information contained on even their personal sites. It would be very beneficial for a user to go onto 
a site and be able to essentially find everything about a group they need to know.
